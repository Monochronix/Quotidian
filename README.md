Hello, my name is Kyle Huang. I am a 13 year old currently studying finance and economics, and I had the idea of making a nonprofit called "Quotidian Finance". It would be dedicated to teaching people my age financial literacy, and courses related to money. This would be a nonprofit sponsored by an organization like Hack+, and it would be great to spread that type of knowledge. This is the first iteration of the website, and I'll create more as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS. The goal is to eventually implement frameworks like React, Vite, Vue, etc. Currently, I see that my knowledge is lacking, but I can't really spend too much time programming as I need to study for the 2024 AMC 10.
